The project was created with create-react-app. I've chosen that tool, because it is so efficent for small
projects and save a lot of time. It takes so much time to configure bundlers, to install all tools, and 
to decide project structure. I created structure based on module structure and single responsibility principle.
That means that each folder is responsible for only one job. There is one container component and one dummy. 
Container is responsible for getting data, for connecting to Redux store, and to passing that data to component. 
I've decided to use table structure for the component, because it's more semantic way to show this kind
of structures, and it is configurable and can grow, in case of items count grow. The service file is 
responsible for fake server calls, which are asinchronous and takes time to be finished. Because there is 
no server which we can connect, there is no data handling and changing logic, just timeouts to simulate
async calls. For changing data and modifaing it there is redux logic and it do its job. I also provided
router function, for future, and for configuring project right from start. I write two tests, as you
mentioned in task requirements, one for reducer,and one for component. They are simple and don't contain 
much logic.That's all. Hope that my job will meet your expectations.
